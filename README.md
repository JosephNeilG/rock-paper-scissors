# Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game
 a simple rock paper scissors game against the computer.

 ### Live Repository

 ### What I Learned
 - basic DOM Manipulation.  
 - use of event listeners (adding, removing).  

 <h3>Things I might add
 - display the icon of the player, and computer's choice instead of  just a string.  

 ### Reflection: things to improve
 - efficiency in writing code.  
 - game ui, must have the feels of playing the game.  
 - logical thinking.
